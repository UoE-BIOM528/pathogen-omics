Welcome to the UoE BIOM528 Workshop pages

In this course we will introduce the key concepts of genomics and apply these techniques to the study of an important fungal pathogen *Zymoseptoria tritici*, which causes wheat blotch disease. Through a series of practical sessions you will gain hands-on experience of applying common bioinformatics tools to perform genome assembly, gene prediction, protein family identification and infer positive selection. At each stage you will learn about common bioinformatics file formats, software tools for the analysis of biological data and inference of the results.
